# phase-1code-challenge

intro
This is an individual labwork where I am supposed to complete a set of three given challenges:
CHALLENGE NO. 1:Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 
Instructions
The first thing to do is to first declare variables a and a prompt message to engage the user
The marks entered
You can use the if conditional statement to output the first fulfilled condition.
In the next phase use else if conditional statements in the code to fulfil the conditions and display a grade
Submision
commit my work and solutions to the above challenge

//CHALLENGE NO. 2 :Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
intro
Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
Instructions
Declare the function checkSpeed and its parameters-->function checkSpeed(vSpeed)
Declare variables to be used -->const sLimit; const sRate;
write the code where the conditonal output is Okay, this means the vehicle is traveling within speed limit.
write condition set for when a vehicle overspeeds and the demerits of points including suspended license, where the demerit points are more than 12.
Finally write prompt where the user is asked to input the vehicle speed
Conclusion 
Submit the work on github by adding and commiting my work, then push.
