# phase-1 code-challenge

**introduction**
This is an individual labwork where I am supposed to complete a set of three given challenges:

**Installation and project setup**

This project requires a computer installed with node or other compilers to run the code; a text editor, preferably VS code to write your code and also a browser for you to test the code.  


**CHALLENGE NO. 1:Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)**

Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 

**Instructions**

The first thing to do is to first declare variables a and a prompt message to engage the user
The marks entered

You can use the if conditional statement to output the first fulfilled condition.

In the next phase use else if conditional statements in the code to fulfil the conditions and display a grade


//**CHALLENGE NO. 2 :Speed Detector (Toy Problem)**


Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”.
Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
Instructions

Declare the function checkSpeed and its parameters-->function checkSpeed(vSpeed)
Declare variables to be used -->const sLimit; const sRate;

write the code where the conditonal output is Okay, this means the vehicle is traveling within speed limit.

write condition set for when a vehicle overspeeds and the demerits of points including suspended license, where the demerit points are more than 12.

Finally write prompt where the user is asked to input the vehicle speed
Conclusion 

**Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)**
